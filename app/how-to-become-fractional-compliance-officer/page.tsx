const CAREER_FAQS = [
  {
    question: 'How much experience do I need to become a fractional compliance officer?',
    answer: 'Most fractional compliance officers have 10-15+ years of compliance experience in FCA-regulated firms, including 3-5+ years in senior compliance roles (Head of Compliance, CCO, or senior manager level). For SMF16/SMF17 roles, you typically need prior FCA approval history. Consultancy roles without SMF accountability may accept 8-10 years experience.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What qualifications do fractional compliance officers need?',
    answer: 'Common qualifications include ICA (International Compliance Association) Certificate or Diploma, CISI Diploma in Investment Compliance, and/or legal qualifications (solicitor/barrister). While not mandatory, these demonstrate professional competence. More important is practical experience and track record in FCA-regulated environments.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much can I earn as a fractional compliance officer?',
    answer: 'Fractional compliance officers earn £800-£1,500 per day, depending on seniority and SMF accountability. Working 3 days per week across clients, annual earnings range from £115,000-£230,000. Most start with 1-2 clients and build to 3-4, optimising for income while maintaining quality.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need professional indemnity insurance?',
    answer: 'Yes, professional indemnity (PI) insurance is essential. Most clients require £1-2 million minimum cover. PI insurance protects against claims arising from professional advice. Expect to pay £1,500-£4,000 annually depending on coverage level and claims history.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I set up a limited company?',
    answer: 'Most fractional compliance officers operate through limited companies for tax efficiency and liability protection. Ltd company structure allows dividend payments, pension contributions, and expense deductions. However, consider IR35 implications—many engagements may be caught by IR35, particularly SMF roles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I find my first fractional compliance clients?',
    answer: 'First clients typically come from: your professional network (former colleagues, clients, contacts), compliance consultancies seeking associate capacity, recruitment agencies with interim/contract desks, LinkedIn outreach and content, referrals from lawyers and accountants serving FinTech, and direct approaches to newly authorised FCA firms.'

              The UK market for fractional compliance has grown significantly, driven by FinTech expansion,
              regulatory complexity, and cost pressures on regulated firms. For compliance professionals with
              the right experience and credentials, fractional work can be both financially rewarding and
              professionally fulfilling.

                Fractional work suits self-motivated professionals comfortable with business development,

                prefer job security, employer-provided benefits, and deep integration with a single organisation.
