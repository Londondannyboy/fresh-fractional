    question: 'What does "fractional" mean in fractional CMO?',
    answer: '"Fractional" means part-time or partial. A fractional CMO works a fraction of a full-time schedule—typically 1-3 days per week or 20-60% of full-time hours. The term comes from working a "fraction" of the week rather than the full five days.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is a fractional CMO the same as a part-time CMO?',
    answer: 'Yes, fractional CMO and part-time CMO mean essentially the same thing—a Chief Marketing Officer who works less than full-time. "Fractional" is the preferred industry term because it emphasizes the senior executive nature of the role, while "part-time" can sometimes imply junior or temporary.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What does a fractional CMO do?',
    answer: 'A fractional CMO provides the same strategic leadership as a full-time CMO: developing marketing strategy, building and leading teams, managing budgets, driving customer acquisition, and owning marketing results. They just do it 1-3 days per week instead of five.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is fractional CMO different from a consultant?',
    answer: 'A fractional CMO is an embedded executive leader who owns marketing results and manages your team. A consultant provides advice but doesn\'t typically manage people or own execution. Fractional CMOs are accountable for outcomes, not just recommendations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do companies hire fractional CMOs instead of full-time?',
    answer: 'Companies hire fractional CMOs to get senior marketing expertise without the £150k-£250k+ cost of a full-time executive. It\'s ideal for startups, scale-ups, or mid-sized companies that need strategic leadership but don\'t have budget or workload for a full-time CMO.',

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Let's break down the term piece by piece:
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-8 rounded-lg my-8 border-l-4 border-amber-500">

              <p className="mb-0 text-gray-700">
                <strong>"Fractional"</strong> refers to working a <em>fraction</em> or <em>portion</em> of full-time hours.
                A fractional executive works part-time—typically 20-60% of a normal full-time schedule (1-3 days per week).
                The term emphasizes that you're getting a "slice" of a senior executive's time, not their full capacity.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-8 rounded-lg my-8 border-l-4 border-amber-500">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-0 mb-4">CMO (Chief Marketing Officer)</h3>
              <p className="mb-0 text-gray-700">
                A <strong>CMO</strong> is the senior executive responsible for all marketing activities in a company.
                They set marketing strategy, build and lead the marketing team, manage budgets, drive customer acquisition,
                and are accountable for marketing results and revenue growth.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg">
              Put them together: A <strong>fractional CMO</strong> provides all the strategic leadership of a full-time CMO,
              but works part-time—giving you senior marketing expertise without the £150,000-£250,000+ annual cost of a full-time executive.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-16">Why the Word "Fractional"?</h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              The term "fractional" became popular in the executive world because it clearly communicates the model:
              you're hiring a <em>fraction</em> of an executive's time, not the whole person.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg">
              Think of it like fractional ownership in real estate or aviation. With fractional jet ownership,
              you own a <em>share</em> of a private jet and get access to it several times per month—without
              the cost of owning an entire aircraft. Similarly, with a fractional CMO, you get access to senior
              marketing leadership several days per week—without the cost of a full-time executive.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-amber-50 border-l-4 border-amber-500 p-8 my-10">

                💡 Industry Note
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                "Fractional" is the preferred term in professional services because it emphasizes the <strong>senior executive</strong> nature
                of the role. "Part-time CMO" means the same thing but can sometimes sound less strategic. In the UK, you'll
                also hear "interim CMO" (temporary, full-time) or "portfolio CMO" (working with multiple companies).
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-16">How Does a Fractional CMO Work?</h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              A fractional CMO typically works with your company 1-3 days per week, spread across the month:
            </p>

            <ul className="text-lg space-y-3">
              <li><strong>1 day per week (20%):</strong> Light strategic oversight. Best for companies with a strong marketing team that just needs executive guidance.</li>
              <li><strong>2 days per week (40%):</strong> Most common model. Enough time for strategic leadership, team management, and driving key initiatives.</li>
              <li><strong>3 days per week (60%):</strong> Hands-on leadership. For companies that need active involvement in execution, hiring, and building the marketing function.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-lg">
              They usually charge by day rate (£700-£1,400 per day in the UK) or monthly retainer (£3,000-£5,500 for 1-2 days per week).
              Many fractional CMOs work with 2-4 companies simultaneously, allowing them to share best practices and fresh
              perspectives across different businesses.
