                <strong>"Fractional COO"</strong> means a Chief Operating Officer who works <strong>part-time</strong> (a "fraction" of full-time hours)—typically 1-3 days per week—providing strategic operational leadership to multiple companies simultaneously.

            <h2>Breaking Down the Term</h2>

            <h3>"Fractional" Explained</h3>
            <p>
              The word "fractional" refers to <strong>time commitment</strong>, not capability or authority. A fractional COO works a fraction of full-time hours but delivers full-time-caliber strategic leadership.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1 day/week</strong> = 20% of full-time = "1/5th fractional"</li>
              <li><strong>2 days/week</strong> = 40% of full-time = "2/5th fractional"</li>
              <li><strong>3 days/week</strong> = 60% of full-time = "3/5th fractional"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>"COO" Explained</h3>
            <p>
              COO stands for Chief Operating Officer—the executive responsible for managing day-to-day operations, building systems, leading teams, and ensuring the company executes efficiently. The COO typically reports directly to the CEO.
            </p>

            <h2>Why "Fractional" Not "Part-Time"?</h2>
            <p>
              The industry uses "fractional" instead of "part-time" for important reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>"Part-time" implies junior or reduced responsibility</strong> — Fractional COOs have full executive authority and experience</li>
              <li><strong>"Fractional" emphasizes the time model</strong> — Working with multiple companies, dedicating a fraction to each</li>
              <li><strong>"Part-time" suggests less commitment</strong> — Fractional COOs are deeply committed during their scheduled time</li>
              <li><strong>"Fractional" is the established industry term</strong> — Used across all executive roles (CFO, CMO, CTO, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alternative Terms</h2>
            <p>You might also hear:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Part-time COO</strong> — Same meaning, less common in professional circles</li>
              <li><strong>Interim COO</strong> — Different: works full-time temporarily during transitions</li>
              <li><strong>Outsourced COO</strong> — Similar but implies more transactional relationship</li>
              <li><strong>Virtual COO</strong> — Emphasizes remote work but otherwise same as fractional</li>
              <li><strong>Contract COO</strong> — Emphasizes contractor status vs employee</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Fractional COO Differs</h2>
            <p><strong>vs Full-Time COO:</strong> Same expertise and authority, but works 1-3 days/week instead of 5 days. 60-70% less cost.</p>
            <p><strong>vs Operations Consultant:</strong> Fractional COOs make decisions and execute. Consultants advise and leave implementation to you.</p>
            <p><strong>vs Interim COO:</strong> Fractional works part-time ongoing. Interim works full-time temporarily (during transitions).</p>
