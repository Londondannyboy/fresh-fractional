  {
    question: "What does a Fractional CTO do?",
    answer: "A Fractional CTO handles strategic technical leadership: architecture decisions, technology strategy, engineering team leadership, technical hiring, security/compliance, technical due diligence for investors, and vendor management. They work 1-3 days per week but take full ownership of technology outcomes."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a Fractional CTO earn?",
    answer: "Fractional CTOs in the UK typically earn £150,000-£300,000+ annually. With 2-4 clients at £850-£1,600/day each working 2-3 days per week per client, many fractional CTOs earn significantly more than full-time CTO roles while enjoying flexibility."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a Fractional CTO worth it?",
    answer: "Yes, if you're a £1M-£20M revenue company with 5-25 engineers needing CTO expertise but can't justify full-time cost. You get 50-60% cost savings, senior expertise (15-20+ years), flexibility to scale, and can start within days vs months for full-time hires."
  },
  {
    question: "How many hours does a Fractional CTO work?",
    answer: "Typical engagements are 1-3 days per week (8-24 hours weekly) or 40-120 hours monthly. The exact hours depend on company size, engineering team size, and current needs (e.g., major architecture work or fundraising requires more hours)."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Fractional and Interim CTO?",
    answer: "Fractional CTOs work part-time ongoing (1-3 days/week, 6-18+ months), focusing on strategic leadership. Interim CTOs work full-time temporarily (3-12 months) to fill a gap during transitions. Fractional is more cost-effective for ongoing strategic needs without requiring daily presence."
  },
  {
    question: "Can a Fractional CTO work remotely?",
    answer: "Yes, most fractional CTO work is now hybrid or fully remote. Typical model: 1 day/week onsite for key meetings (all-hands, architecture reviews, stakeholder meetings), 1-2 days remote. Fully remote is increasingly common, especially for SaaS and tech companies with distributed teams."

                A <strong className="font-bold">Fractional CTO</strong> is an experienced Chief Technology Officer who provides strategic technical leadership to companies on a <strong>part-time basis</strong>—typically working 1-3 days per week. Unlike technical consultants, fractional CTOs become embedded members of your leadership team, leading your engineering organization, making architecture decisions, and driving technology outcomes at <strong>50-60% less cost</strong> than a full-time CTO hire.

              Think of a fractional CTO as your company's senior technology leader—attending leadership meetings, making technical decisions, mentoring engineers, representing technology to your board and investors, and taking ownership of your technical strategy—just not five days a week.
            </p>

            <p>
              The "fractional" model allows companies to access <strong>CTO-level expertise and experience</strong> (typically 15-20+ years in senior technology roles) without the commitment, cost, and overhead of a full-time executive hire. According to <a href="https://octoverse.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">GitHub's State of the Octoverse</a>, the technology landscape is increasingly complex, making senior technical leadership more valuable than ever. The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">Office for National Statistics</a> reports that part-time senior executive roles have grown 43% since 2020, reflecting the shift toward flexible leadership models.
