  {
    question: 'What is a fractional executive?',
    answer: 'A fractional executive is an experienced C-suite leader who works with companies on a part-time basis, typically 1-3 days per week. They provide senior leadership—such as CFO, CMO, CTO, or COO expertise—without the cost of a full-time hire. The term "fractional" refers to working a fraction of full-time hours.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much do fractional executives cost?',
    answer: 'Fractional executives in the UK typically charge £700-£1,500 per day, depending on role and experience. At 1-2 days per week, this translates to £35,000-£150,000 annually—compared to £150,000-£300,000+ for a full-time C-suite executive. Most companies save 50-70% versus a full-time hire.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What roles do fractional executives fill?',
    answer: 'The most common fractional executive roles are CFO (Chief Financial Officer), CMO (Chief Marketing Officer), CTO (Chief Technology Officer), COO (Chief Operating Officer), CHRO (Chief Human Resources Officer), and CISO (Chief Information Security Officer). Essentially any C-suite function can be filled fractionally.',
  },
  {
    question: 'When should a company hire a fractional executive?',
    answer: 'Companies typically hire fractional executives when they need senior expertise but cannot justify or afford a full-time hire. Common triggers include preparing for fundraising, scaling rapidly, needing specialized expertise, building out a function from scratch, or covering a gap while recruiting a permanent executive.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is a fractional executive different from a consultant?',
    answer: 'Unlike consultants who advise from the outside, fractional executives become embedded members of your leadership team. They attend board meetings, manage teams, own outcomes, and take accountability for their function. They are essentially your CFO, CMO, or CTO—just part-time rather than full-time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I become a fractional executive?',
    answer: 'To become a fractional executive, you typically need 15-20+ years of experience with significant time in senior leadership roles. Building a fractional practice requires developing a clear niche, building a referral network, establishing your personal brand, and learning to manage multiple clients simultaneously.',

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              The fractional executive model has exploded over the past decade. What started as an ad-hoc solution for startups that couldn't afford full-time executives has evolved into a legitimate career path for senior leaders and a strategic advantage for growing companies.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              According to research from the <a href="https://www.scaleupinstitute.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline">ScaleUp Institute</a>, the demand for flexible executive talent has grown 300% since 2019. The <a href="https://www.iod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline">Institute of Directors</a> reports that over 40% of UK scale-ups now use some form of fractional leadership.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                Three forces have accelerated the shift to fractional executives: <strong>remote work</strong> (executives can serve multiple clients efficiently), <strong>economic uncertainty</strong> (companies want flexibility over fixed costs), and <strong>lifestyle preferences</strong> (senior leaders seeking portfolio careers over single-employer roles).

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-16">How Fractional Executives Work</h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              A fractional executive typically works with 2-4 companies simultaneously, dedicating 1-3 days per week to each client. Unlike consultants who advise from the outside, fractional executives become embedded members of the leadership team.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-gray-50 p-8 rounded-lg my-8 border-l-4 border-purple-500">
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-0 mb-4">Typical Engagement Model</h3>
              <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-3 mb-0">
                <li><strong>Time commitment:</strong> 1-3 days per week (8-24 hours)</li>
                <li><strong>Contract length:</strong> 6-12 months, often extending to 2-3+ years</li>
                <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Day rate (£700-£1,600) or monthly retainer (£3,000-£8,000)</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Can scale up/down based on company needs</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p className="text-lg">
              The key distinction from consulting is <strong>ownership and accountability</strong>. A fractional CFO doesn't just advise on financial strategy—they own it. They attend board meetings, manage the finance team, present to investors, and are accountable for financial outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-16">When to Hire a Fractional Executive</h2>

            <p className="text-lg">
              Companies typically hire fractional executives at specific inflection points. According to research from <a href="https://www.bvca.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline">BVCA</a>, the most common triggers are:
            </p>

            <ul className="text-lg space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Fundraising:</strong> Need credible financial leadership for due diligence and investor relations</li>
              <li><strong>Rapid growth:</strong> Scaling from £1M to £10M+ and founder-led functions are bottlenecking</li>
              <li><strong>Specific expertise:</strong> Need a specialist skill (M&A, PLG marketing, AI architecture) that's overkill full-time</li>
              <li><strong>Building a function:</strong> Creating a marketing, finance, or tech team from scratch</li>
              <li><strong>Gap coverage:</strong> An executive has left and need coverage during recruitment</li>
              <li><strong>Strategic initiative:</strong> Major project (digital transformation, market expansion) requiring senior leadership</li>
            </ul>

            <div className="bg-purple-50 border-l-4 border-purple-500 p-8 my-10">
              <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
                The "Right Stage" for Fractional
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0">
                The sweet spot for fractional executives is companies with <strong>£1M-£30M revenue</strong>. Below £1M, founders usually handle everything themselves. Above £30M, companies typically need—and can afford—full-time C-suite. The fractional model bridges the gap, providing senior expertise during the critical scaling years.
              </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-16">Fractional Executive Costs</h2>

              Fractional executives typically charge by day rate or monthly retainer. Here's what to expect in the UK market:
