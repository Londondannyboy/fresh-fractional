          <h2>What is a Part-Time CFO?</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>part-time CFO</strong> (also known as a fractional CFO or outsourced CFO) is an experienced Chief Financial Officer who provides strategic financial leadership to companies on a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">flexible, part-time basis</a>. <strong>Part time CFO services</strong> allow businesses to access senior finance expertise without the cost of a full-time hire. Rather than committing to a single full-time role, <strong>part time CFOs</strong> typically work with multiple clients, dedicating 1-3 days per week to each engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The demand for <strong>part time CFO jobs</strong> in the UK has grown significantly. Whether you're a business with a <strong>part time CFO wanted</strong> requirement, or a finance professional seeking <strong>CFO part time</strong> opportunities, the market is thriving. <a href="https://www.scaleupinstitute.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">Startups, scale-ups</a>, and SMEs increasingly need senior financial expertise but cannot justify a full-time hire. Companies typically engage a part-time CFO when they reach Series A funding, need to prepare financial models for investors, or require board-level financial reporting.
          </p>

          <h2>Part-Time CFO vs Full-Time CFO</h2>
          <p>
            The key difference between a part-time CFO and a traditional full-time CFO lies in the engagement model. A full-time CFO works exclusively for one company, typically earning £150,000-£300,000 annually plus benefits. A <strong>part-time Chief Financial Officer</strong>, by contrast, works with 2-4 clients simultaneously, charging day rates of £800-£1,500.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many experienced CFOs, the part-time model offers significant advantages: higher effective hourly earnings, greater variety in work, portfolio diversification, and improved work-life balance. For companies, hiring a part-time CFO provides access to senior talent at a fraction of the cost of a full-time hire.
          </p>

          <h2>Who Hires Part-Time CFOs?</h2>
          <p>
            Which companies have <strong>part time CFO wanted</strong> or <strong>part time CFO needed</strong> requirements? <strong>Part-time CFO jobs</strong> are most common in the following company types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Venture-backed startups</strong> - Companies at Series A or B stage that need fundraising support, financial modelling, and investor relations expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Private equity portfolio companies</strong> - <a href="https://www.bvca.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">PE firms</a> often require part-time CFOs to strengthen finance functions across their investments</li>
            <li><strong>Scale-ups</strong> - Fast-growing companies (£5-50m revenue) that have outgrown their bookkeeper but aren't ready for a full-time CFO</li>
            <li><strong>SMEs preparing for exit</strong> - Business owners planning a sale who need to professionalise their finances with support from the <a href="https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">British Business Bank</a></li>
            <li><strong>Turnaround situations</strong> - Companies in financial distress that need experienced leadership</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Part-Time CFO Salary and Day Rates</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Part-time CFO</strong> compensation in the UK typically ranges from £800 to £1,500 per day, depending on experience, industry specialisation, and location. London-based roles command premium rates, with City and Canary Wharf engagements often paying £1,200-£1,500 per day. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">ONS data</a> shows senior finance professionals increasingly choosing flexible working arrangements.
          </p>
          <p>
            A part-time CFO working 2-3 days per week across multiple clients can realistically earn £150,000-£250,000 annually. The most experienced fractional CFOs with strong networks and repeat clients can earn significantly more.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>Part-time CFO responsibilities typically include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Financial strategy development and execution</li>
            <li>Cash flow forecasting and management</li>

          </ul>

          <h2>How to Become a Part-Time CFO</h2>
          <p>
            Transitioning to a <strong>part-time CFO career</strong> typically requires 15+ years of finance experience, including at least 5 years in senior leadership roles. Most successful part-time CFOs hold professional qualifications (<a href="https://www.icaew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">ACA</a>, <a href="https://www.accaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">ACCA</a>, <a href="https://www.cimaglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">CIMA</a>) and have experience across multiple industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building a portfolio of clients takes time. Many part-time CFOs start by taking on one or two fractional engagements alongside consulting work, gradually building their client base through referrals and networking. <a href="https://www.ipse.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">Self-employed professionals</a> benefit from understanding freelance finance leadership models. Platforms like <Link href="/fractional-jobs-uk">Fractional Quest</Link> can help connect experienced CFOs with companies seeking part-time finance leadership.
          </p>

          <h2>Remote CFO Jobs</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Remote CFO jobs</strong> have become increasingly common since 2020, aligned with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">UK flexible working rights</a>. Many <strong>part time CFOs</strong> now work entirely remotely or in hybrid arrangements, using modern finance software and video conferencing to deliver their services. This has opened up the market significantly—a company in Manchester can now engage a London-based <strong>part-time CFO</strong> without the need for regular in-person meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            For CFOs seeking <strong>remote CFO jobs</strong>, the flexibility is a major attraction. You can work with clients across the UK (and internationally) from your home office, making <strong>CFO part time</strong> work even more appealing.

Many of these roles are available as <strong>remote CFO jobs</strong>, giving you flexibility regardless of location.
