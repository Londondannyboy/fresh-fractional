  {
    question: "What does 'fractional' mean in business?",
    answer: "In business, 'fractional' means engaging senior executives or specialists on a part-time basis (typically 20-60% time) rather than full-time. Fractional professionals work with multiple clients simultaneously, providing high-level expertise without the cost and commitment of full-time employment."
  },
  {
    question: "Why is it called 'fractional' CTO?",
    answer: "It's called fractional because you're accessing a 'fraction' of the executive's time—typically 1-3 days per week instead of 5 days. You get a fraction of their time but 100% of their expertise, experience, and commitment during their working days."
  },
  {
    question: "Is fractional the same as part-time?",
    answer: "Yes and no. Fractional executives work part-time hours (1-3 days/week), but unlike traditional part-time employees, they're senior strategic leaders with full accountability, they work with multiple clients, charge premium rates, and focus on high-value strategic work, not reduced-responsibility roles."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between fractional and freelance CTO?",
    answer: "Fractional CTOs are embedded strategic leaders who attend board meetings, lead teams, and take ownership of outcomes for 6-18+ months. Freelance CTOs typically do shorter-term project work without the same level of integration and ongoing accountability."

              The term "fractional" in business refers to accessing executive talent for a fraction of full-time hours. It's different from traditional part-time work because fractional executives maintain full strategic responsibility and leadership authority—they're not doing reduced-scope work, they're doing full CTO work in fewer days.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-0"><strong>Part-time employees</strong> typically work reduced hours in junior or mid-level roles (e.g., part-time developer). <strong>Fractional executives</strong> are senior leaders (CTO, CFO, CMO level) working strategically, not tactically. Fractional professionals also work with multiple clients and charge premium day rates, not salaries.</p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">The Fractional Executive Model</h3>

            <p>
              The fractional model originated in finance with Fractional CFOs in the 1990s and has expanded to other C-suite roles as companies realize that many executive functions don't require 40 hours weekly. According to <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 underline">ONS employment data</a>, fractional and flexible executive roles have grown significantly in the UK tech sector since 2020.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fractional executives typically work with 2-4 companies simultaneously, each receiving 1-3 days per week. This model benefits everyone:
            </p>

            <ul className="space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Companies:</strong> Access senior expertise at 50-60% cost savings, with flexibility to scale up/down</li>
              <li><strong>Executives:</strong> Work with multiple interesting companies, maintain variety, often earn more than full-time roles</li>
              <li><strong>Market:</strong> Efficient allocation of scarce executive talent to companies that need it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-black text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Why "Fractional CTO" Makes Sense</h3>

            <p>
              The CTO role is particularly well-suited to the fractional model because much of the work is strategic and episodic rather than operational and daily. Architecture decisions, technology strategy, security planning, and team leadership don't require constant presence—they require senior thinking at critical moments.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600 p-6 my-8">
              <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">What a CTO Does in 1-3 Days/Week:</p>
              <ul className="space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-0">
                <li>• Review and approve major architecture decisions</li>
                <li>• Attend leadership and board meetings</li>
                <li>• Mentor Tech Leads and senior engineers</li>
                <li>• Handle investor technical due diligence</li>
                <li>• Set technology strategy and roadmap</li>
                <li>• Make build-vs-buy and vendor decisions</li>
                <li>• Conduct key technical hires and interviews</li>
                <li>• Review security and compliance posture</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              For companies with 5-20 engineers, these activities fill 1-3 days per week. Once systems are running well, the fractional CTO can scale down to 1 day per week for ongoing oversight. For implementation, you rely on your Tech Lead, engineers, and DevOps team.
            </p>

            <ul className="space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Strategic needs &gt; operational needs:</strong> You need senior thinking more than daily execution</li>
              <li><strong>5-20 engineers:</strong> Large enough to need CTO expertise, small enough that 1-3 days/week suffices</li>
              <li><strong>£1M-£20M revenue:</strong> Can't justify £250k+ full-time CTO but need senior technical leadership</li>
              <li><strong>Strong Tech Lead in place:</strong> Day-to-day technical management is handled by Tech Lead or EM</li>
              <li><strong>Mature engineering practices:</strong> CI/CD working, development processes established, not firefighting daily</li>
